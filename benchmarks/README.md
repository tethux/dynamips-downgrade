# Guest memory benchmark

Run `mise run test:memory` for correctness and `mise run bench:memory` for
optimized timings. The benchmark task selects release mode and system packages.
For repeatable CPU affinity on Linux, run the built executable with
`taskset -c 2 build/linux/x86_64/release/memory-bench`, choosing an available CPU.

The benchmark performs big-endian 64-bit RAM loads, uses precomputed address
traces, checks every path against raw RAM, and reports the median of five samples
of 1,048,576 accesses. Paths are interleaved with rotating order for each sample.
Setup and mapping are outside the timed sections. The
new direct path permits inlining; callback paths use an opaque function pointer.
Raw RAM is a lower-bound reference without address translation or permissions.

The legacy fixture uses the real `mips64_mts64_init`, memory-operation vector,
and RAM device lookup from Dynamips, including cache refills. It does not model
the legacy algorithm in benchmark code. Its extra memory-operation dispatch and
register write are part of that callback contract. These results do not compare
against the legacy inline JIT memory path or establish whole-emulator speedups.

The workloads cover a hot 16-page working set, L1 conflicts, large page strides,
legacy-cache conflicts, and random accesses over 4,096 pages. The folded L2 index
reduces aligned-stride conflicts, but any finite direct-mapped cache can still
thrash. The correctness test includes addresses that collide in both new levels.

`jit.memory` currently owns an explicit page map for one execution context.
RAM occupies physical `[0, ram.size())`; MMIO pages cannot overlap it. RAM and
device objects are borrowed and must remain stable until unmapped. Mapping and
callback changes require stopped execution. Every mapping change invalidates
affected entries in all access caches. No allocation occurs on RAM hits, cache
refills, or mapping changes within the startup capacity.

This is not an architectural MIPS CP0 TLB implementation. ASIDs, segment rules,
guest TLB instructions, precise architectural exception delivery, and inline JIT
cache probing remain separate work. MMIO callbacks receive the requested byte
order and exchange numeric values once per access; scalar RAM operations support
explicit big/little endianness and
natural alignment for 1, 2, 4, and 8 bytes.


## IOS boot timing

Build both standalone binaries in release mode with the AMD64 JIT selected
(`--dynamips_arch=amd64`), then compare the same extracted C7200 IOS ELF:

```sh
python3 benchmarks/boot.py build/linux/x86_64/release/dynamips \
  --core legacy --image /path/to/c7200.image --label legacy --cpu 2
python3 benchmarks/boot.py build/linux/x86_64/release/c7200-boot \
  --image /path/to/c7200.image --label new --cpu 2
```

Choose an available CPU. The harness records three warm-file-cache process
starts, measures launch to the first IOS banner, and writes console logs and
JSON under `build/boot-bench`. Both machines use NPE-400 and 256 MiB RAM. The
legacy console uses TCP because its terminal transport does not emit guest
output through a redirected terminal. Legacy execution stops at the banner;
the new core exits at its documented unsupported-device checkpoint. These
measurements do not compare CLI readiness or networking.

For a separate CPU sample, pass `--runs 1 --profiler /path/to/libprofiler.so`
to the new-core command and keep release symbols/frame pointers in that
binary. Dependencies of the profiler must be on the library search path.
Google perftools may append a PID to the `.prof` filename. Analyze the result
with `go tool pprof -top -cum /path/to/binary /path/to/profile`. Sampled runs
include profiler overhead and must not be used for before/after timings.

The JSON also reports peak child RSS (KiB on Linux) across the run group.
It includes the full process lifetime, including teardown after the banner.

For an alternating comparison (seven starts per core, reversing each pair):

```sh
python3 benchmarks/boot_compare.py NEW_RELEASE_BINARY LEGACY_RELEASE_BINARY \
  --image /path/to/c7200.image --cpu 2 --runs 7
```

This records both medians, individual samples, image hash and console logs.
A measured checkpoint on Linux amd64 gave 1.026 s new versus 1.111 s legacy.
Timing includes process startup and ends at the IOS banner, not a working CLI.
The cold interpreter avoids compiling one-off blocks. Bounded native traces,
checked RAM probes and successor lookup hints reduce execution overhead;
every hinted successor still undergoes normal code/mapping validation.

## IOS console readiness

Use the same extracted image and CPU affinity for full startup comparisons.
This harness requires the actual `Router>` prompt and records launch, banner,
RETURN, prompt, child CPU time, image hash and console logs under
`build/cli-bench/`. It uses NPE-400 with 256 MiB RAM and empty card slots.

```sh
python3 benchmarks/cli.py /path/to/legacy/dynamips --core legacy \
  --image /path/to/c7200.image --label legacy --cpu 2 --runs 3
python3 benchmarks/cli.py /path/to/c7200-boot --core boot \
  --image /path/to/c7200.image --label new --cpu 2 --runs 3
```

Use `--core cli` for the convenience CLI's `run IMAGE --console PATH` syntax.
The harness terminates each emulator after the prompt; it does not validate
networking, saved state or legacy teardown. Run timing separately from profiling
and compilation. Shared-host scheduling and CPU frequency still affect results.

The full-startup profile found repeated Asio console polls during silent guest
execution: up to five polls per 64-block CPU slice. Host console input now polls
at most once per millisecond when idle; pending output bypasses that cadence.
Guest instruction accounting and the CP0 clock model are unchanged.

Three runs per core on the same host, pinned to CPU 2, using the same IOS
12.4(24)T5 ELF and NPE-400/256 MiB configuration gave these medians:

| Core | Launch → Router> | Banner → Router> | Child CPU time |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Before polling fix | 192.845 s | 186.364 s | 170.647 s |
| Fixed native CLI | 46.123 s | 44.861 s | 45.187 s |
| Legacy | 16.076 s | 14.706 s | 13.587 s |

These are full CLI-startup observations, not the earlier launch-to-banner
benchmark. The shared host had variable load (the baseline launch samples ranged
from 171.7 to 250.4 s, including concurrent build activity); do not treat the
76% median wall-time reduction as a precision throughput measurement. The CPU
samples also fell substantially. Legacy remains faster at this checkpoint.
A separate sampled run attributed about 52% of baseline CPU time to console
servicing. A Count-trace experiment passed semantic tests but did not show a
useful startup CPU-time improvement and is not included in this change.

A later comparison used three rounds, reversing parent/candidate/legacy order
on alternate rounds, without concurrent builds or CPU sampling. The same image,
CPU 2 and machine configuration gave these medians:

| Core | Launch → Router> | Banner → Router> | Child CPU time |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Parent CLI stack | 44.929 s | 43.618 s | 44.741 s |
| Dispatch and RAM-version fast paths | 41.104 s | 39.890 s | 40.905 s |
| Legacy | 14.164 s | 13.073 s | 13.965 s |

The candidate launch samples were 41.208, 41.104 and 41.056 s. This is 8.5%
less median startup time than the parent, while legacy remains substantially
faster. Cold interpretation and cache selection are kept out of the dispatch
hot path; successor hits are inlined. Single-counter code stamps and checked
single-RAM-page write notifications avoid general reduction/iteration work.
Cross-page writes, aliases, mapping validation, LL/SC and clock accounting
retain their existing semantics. The broader noncontiguous-trace experiment
regressed this workload and is excluded.
